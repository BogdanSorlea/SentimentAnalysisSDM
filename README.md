SentimentAnalysisSDM
====================

Implementation of sentiment analysis algorithms using labMT word set - and extending the set using Bayes classifier.

Folder structure:
- preprocessing - add scripts related to fetching, sanitizing and serializing data
- implementation - add scripts related to deserializing of data, implementation of sentiment analysis algorithm, training of the Bayesian classifier, etc.
- documents - add relevant documents (e.g. final report, as PDF and only tex file)
- website - add all the content that consists the presentation website
- data - add relevant data (however, consider this as development data - therefore data sets should be rather small to reduce computation time. If larger data sets will be eventually processed, the corresponding files will not be committed here)
